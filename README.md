# AI-ML-Healthcare---Final-Year-Project
# Abstract
Colon and lung cancer present formidable challenges in oncology, highlighting the critical need for early detection and accurate diagnosis to ensure effective treatment. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance cancer diagnosis by focusing on the classification of Digital Whole Slide Images (DWSI) of colon and lung tissues from the LC25000 dataset.

We explore traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised methods, as foundational approaches for precise cancer identification. Building on these fundamentals, the project transitions to a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust feature extraction with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for pattern recognition, significantly improving accuracy.

Note: This repository only contains the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms used in the project. Vision Transformer (ViT) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models, as well as other proprietary models, are not included due to confidentiality.

# Features
ML Algorithms: Implementation of traditional ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest for cancer classification.
CNN-SVM Hybrid Model: Combines the feature extraction power of CNN with the classification efficiency of SVM.
Tools: Built with Google Colab, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

# Introduction
